# The Shrimp Car Repair System Wiki
This system helps a local car repair shop by hosting a website that supports their business. This system will allow customers to book appointments completely online, as opposed to the current method by phone. Additionally, customers can create a profile and pay for their appointments on the platform. The platform is designed such that the administrative assistant still creates and maintains the availabilities for appointments and the technician schedules. The system will also send notifications to customers to remind them to book regular appointments like oil changes, inspections and maintenance. The system shall consist of a web app as well as an android application.
   
# Meet the Team!

### Adel Ahram
A second year computer engineering student who loves hardware just as much as software. If he's not busy trying his best to get out of bed at 8:30 to attend the lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he's probably talking about pc parts and helping friends build a new computer. He also clearly had too much fun writing these teammate descriptions, so enjoy!

### Alexandra Gafencu
Another second year computer engineering student with a fun and artistic side! Not only is she fluent in 5 languages, but she also learned to speak and read Korean all on her own. Alex is a fun person to be around and a great teammate! Just watch out when joking around with her though. If you make a joke that's too on point, you might want to reduce the volume on your speakers.

### Alix Routhier-Lalonde
Yet another second year computer engineering student with a passion for learning on his own and developing his technical side. Alix is the tinkerer of the group, often found surrounded by Arduinos and raspberry PI's. When he's not getting on Adel's nerves, he's probably telling someone about how much switching to Linux can change their life.

### Roey Borsteinas
Just when you thought this team had enough second year computer engineers, you find out that there is yet another. Roey is the tech genius of the team. His C++ skills are unparalleled and his technical prowess is matched by few. Sadly, people who code in JavaScript are simply inferior to him, so you might want to watch out before discussing programming around him.

### Simon Nakane Marcil
If you haven't realized yet, there are only second year computer engineering students on this team. Simon is no exception to this rule. A silent and somewhat mysterious man, Simon can often be found lurking around the team discord server. His expertise in board games is second to none, and his propensity to complete his tasks before anyone even starts theirs make him an S+ tier teammate.
